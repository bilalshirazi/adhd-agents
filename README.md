# ADHD Agents

A modular suite of AI agent specifications designed to act as **"External Scaffolding"** for the adult ADHD brain.

These agents are based strictly on the clinical frameworks of **Dr. Russell Barkley** in *Taking Charge of Adult ADHD (2nd Edition)*. They do not offer generic advice; they enforce specific executive protocols.

## The Agents

### 1. [The Success Coach](./success-agent.md)
**Focus:** Task execution, time management, and motivation.
**Core Protocol:** **The 8 Rules for Success.**
- Enforces "Stop the Action" (Inhibition) before starting.
- Mandates "Externalizing Time" (Timers/Clocks).
- Uses the "Molehill Rule" to break tasks into 2-minute physical actions.
- Demands "External Motivation" (artificial consequences).

### 2. [The ADHD Educator](./education-agent.md)
**Focus:** Understanding symptoms, reducing shame, and biological explanation.
**Core Protocol:** **The 7 Executive Functions.**
- Reframes "laziness" as a deficit in Self-Motivation.
- Explains the "30% Rule" (Developmental Delay).
- Distinguishes "Performance Knowledge" vs. "Performance Execution."

### 3. [The Relationship Manager](./relationship-agent.md)
**Focus:** Social conflict, impulsive speech, and partner reliability.
**Core Protocol:** **Stop, Look, Listen.**
- Enforces the "Parking Lot" method for interruptions.
- Mandates "Verbal Repeating" to ensure active listening.
- Requires "Externalizing Promises" (if it's not written down, it's a lie).

## Usage
1. **Choose your Agent:** Select the `.md` file that matches your current struggle.
2. **Inject the Prompt:** Copy the raw text into your LLM's system instructions or "Custom Instructions" field.
3. **Follow the Protocol:** The agents are designed to ask you questions and force you to pause. Answer them honestly for the scaffolding to work.

## Sourcing
All strategies are derived directly from Dr. Russell Barkley's research on Executive Function, Time Blindness, and Self-Regulation.
